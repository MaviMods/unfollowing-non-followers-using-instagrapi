# Unfollow Non-Followers on Instagram Using Instagrapi

For details on how to automatically unfollow non-followers on Instagram, refer to this [blog post](https://harminder.dev/projects/Social%20media%20automation/Instagram/Unfollowing%20non-followers/Unfollowing_non-followers/).

This Python script uses Instagrapi, which is an unofficial Instagram API wrapper, to unfollow individuals who do not follow you back on Instagram.

**Disclaimer**: Utilizing unofficial APIs can contravene Instagram's terms of service, potentially leading to account suspension or restriction. Exercise caution when using this script.

## Installation

Run the following command to install Instagrapi:
```
pip install instagrapi
```

## Usage

First, update the script with your Instagram credentials:
```
username = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'
```

Execute the script with:
```
python main.py
```

# Unfollow Non-Followers on Instagram Using Instagrapi

Using Instagrapi (an unofficial Instagram API wrapper for Python), you can unfollow everyone who doesn't follow you back on Instagram. Here's a Python script that does it for you.

Please note that using unofficial APIs may violate Instagram's terms of service, and your account could be at risk of being banned or restricted. Use this method with caution.

## Installation
To install this script, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install instagrapi
```

## Usage
Ensure to change the username and password in the script to your own Instagram username and password. 

Replace 
```python
username = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'
```
with your username and password.

After that, run the script using the following command:
```bash
python unfollow_non_followers.py
```
